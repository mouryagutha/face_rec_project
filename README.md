# Face Recognition System

## üìå Project Objective
A face recognition system that captures, trains, and identifies faces using OpenCV and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for efficient recognition.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** OpenCV, NumPy, Tkinter
- **Machine Learning Model:** LBPH Face Recognizer
- **Dataset Handling:** CSV File Management
- **Hardware Requirements:** Webcam

## ‚ú® Features
- Capture and store facial images with unique IDs
- Train the system using LBPH algorithm
- Recognize faces in real-time with confidence scores
- Simple GUI for easy interaction

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning models (CNN) for better accuracy
- Add cloud storage for storing and retrieving face data
- Integrate with IoT for smart access control
- Enhance security with multi-factor authentication
